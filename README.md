A plethora of factors influence the development of infant's gut microbiome. On the track to an adult-like gut microbiome first, the type of milk diet and then the process of weaning offer a changing nutritional environment, In addition, birth-mode, genetic influences, and many more provide a changing basis of the microbiome. Using qiime2 and its various plugins we characterized some of these influences starting with the milk-based diet itself (breast milk or formula and weaning state), going through the birth mode and the genetic effect to predict the diet. In this twin-study we show that the diet is the major factor that leads to changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. These changes also correlates to the age of the infants as the diet changes with age. Additionally, the delivery mode and the genetics have significant effects on the composition of the infant gut microbiome. Our results on the influence of the birth mode and the diet/age adds to the growing evidence on these factors while our analysis of the genetic influence on the infant's gut microbiome provides valuable insights into the controversial discussed subject.
