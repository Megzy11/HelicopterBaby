# HelicopterBaby

In this project we analyse 16S rRNA samples taken at multiple timepoints in the first months of life of human babies.
We analysed the microbial composition and performed statistical tests to compare samples with different metadata such as twin pairs and their zygosity, diet: milk and weaning status. 

## Running the notebooks
1. Run main.ipynb to get the data
2. Run the metadata folder in any order (???) to get an idea of the metadata and their distributions
3. Run ASV/ASV.ipynb
4. Run taxonomy/taxonomy.ipynb
5. Run Phylogeny, alpha and beta diversity/phylogeny.ipynb
6. Run  Phylogeny, alpha and beta diversity/alpha_diversity_1124.ipynb
7. Run  Phylogeny, alpha and beta diversity/beta_diversity.ipynb
8. ...
