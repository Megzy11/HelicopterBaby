id: id of the sample
*library: paired, the sequencing method
****collection date: different sample, checking the how many samples give for each time point
***still need to decide how to play around this part
*lat and lon: identical

*weight, length...
***zygosity: are they all twins?
*delivery term and the delivery 
*background
*diet-milk and diet weaning

Central questions we can answer now:
- difference in birth weight and length in preterm or non-preterm delivery (SVEN)
- percentage of preterm delivery in different delivery modes (SVEN)

Central questions we can answer after microbiome analysis:
- microbiome similarity between mono-/dizygotic twins
- abundance of certain organisms depending on breast-feeding/formula
- difference between the sexes
- differences between twins(to check the hosts' gene/environmental influences for the diversity)
